Recommended Method: Tax-Exclusive (Method 1)
Use “Retail prices excluding tax” as your primary method because:
	1.	FTA Compliance: This is the standard method recognized by FTA
	2.	Audit Trail: Clearer separation between base price and VAT amount
	3.	Business Practice: Most UAE businesses display prices excluding VAT, then add VAT at checkout
	4.	Invoice Requirements: FTA requires tax invoices to show the taxable amount and VAT separately
Your VAT Calculator Should Include:
Core Calculations

For Sales (Output VAT):
- Base Amount (excluding VAT)
- VAT Amount = Base Amount × 0.05
- Total Amount = Base Amount + VAT Amount

For Purchases (Input VAT):
- Same calculation for VAT paid on purchases

Net VAT Liability:
- Payable VAT = Output VAT - Input VAT
