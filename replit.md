## System Architecture

### UI/UX
The frontend is built with React and TypeScript, leveraging Shadcn components and Tailwind CSS for a responsive design. It includes a Home Page, Customer and Admin Login, a Booking Search Landing Page, a 4-step Booking Flow, and a full Admin Panel with Dashboard, Calendar, POS, Finance & Accounting, and management sections for Clients, Services, Staff, and Settings. The UI adheres to a defined color palette and typography.

### Technical Implementation
The backend utilizes a PostgreSQL database and an Express-based REST API.
-   **Database:** PostgreSQL (Neon-backed) stores all core application data.
-   **API:** Provides endpoints for customer-facing features and a robust set of admin routes for resource and financial management.
-   **Authentication:** Replit Auth provides user authentication with role-based access control (customer, staff, admin, super_admin) and secure route protection.
-   **Staff Permissions:** A five-tier system controls staff access levels.
-   **Revenue & Discount Tracking:** Comprehensive system for tracking all revenue streams, including service bookings, retail sales, and loyalty cards, with support for various discount types. All calculations are UAE VAT-compliant (5% VAT is part of the price).
-   **UAE VAT Compliance System:** Optional VAT activation with intelligent invoice classification (full, simplified, standard), TRN management, 5-year data retention, and support for various tax codes. Exports FTA Audit Files.
-   **VAT Threshold Reminder System:** Tracks annual revenue, displays progress towards VAT registration threshold, and sends automated notifications.
-   **Calendar Validation:** Ensures accurate time slot generation based on business hours, service durations, and staff availability.
-   **Multi-Provider Notification System:** Supports Twilio and MSG91 for Email, SMS, and WhatsApp notifications, with AES-256-GCM encryption for credentials and per-spa provider selection. Staff notifications are also configurable.
-   **Audit Trail:** Tracks all significant changes with user context, IP, and user agent.
-   **Security Hardening:** Includes secure ID validation, consistent error handling (Zod), environment variable validation, and multi-tenant security measures to prevent cross-spa data access.
-   **Admin-Spa Linkage & Onboarding:** Robust middleware (`injectAdminSpa`) links admin users to their specific spa. A pending approval workflow and a 6-step setup wizard ensure new admins configure their spa before accessing full features. The wizard covers Basic Info, Location, Business Hours, Services, Staff, and Activation.
-   **Membership Management:** CRUD operations for memberships/packages, supporting one-time/recurring payments, limited/unlimited sessions, validity periods, and online sales toggles. Integrates with invoicing for revenue tracking.
-   **Finance & Accounting Reporting:** Comprehensive dashboard with 5 report types: Finance Summary, Sales Summary, Sales List, Appointments Summary, and Payment Summary. Includes date range filters, sortable columns, and planned export functionality (CSV, Excel, PDF).
